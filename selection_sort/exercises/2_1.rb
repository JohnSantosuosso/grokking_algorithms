#Building an app to keep track of finances
#Every day you write down everything you spend money on
#Lots of inserts and a few reads
#What structure to use?

#If added in the order they occurred--array
#If you plan to add items in the middle or at random places (ie you forgot to record something)--linked list




#Creating a todo list that will change frequently as items move up and down in priority, what to use?

#If you plan to add or delete items frequently--linked list
#Using an array will mean that everything must be moved up when you delete an element
